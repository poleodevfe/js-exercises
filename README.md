This repository, maintained by [poleodevfe](https://github.com/poleodevfe), is intended for practice and exercise purposes in JavaScript. It contains a variety of exercises, each of which is contained within its own dedicated directory.

## Table of Contents

1. [01-automating-gift-wrapping](./src/01-automating-gift-wrapping)
2. [02-no-one-wants-to-do-overtime](./src/02-no-one-wants-to-do-overtime)

Each directory contains its own exercise and relevant files. You can navigate to each exercise by clicking on the links provided in the table of contents.

## How to Use

You can use this repository to practice your JS/TS skills. To do this, you can clone the repository, navigate to an exercise directory, and begin working on the exercise.

Please note that each exercise is standalone and meant to be independent from the others. This means you can choose to work on any exercise without needing to complete the others first.
